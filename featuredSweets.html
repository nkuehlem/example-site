                <p>Interesting fact #2: Loves cookies</p>
                <p>EMail: <a href="mailto:%20? subject=from design system">GastonLenôtre@gmail.com</a></p>
            </div>
                <p>Lenôtre was born on a small farm in Normandy. Both of his parents eventually moved the family to Paris and became restaurant workers. Eventually his father's ill health forced them to move back to the province from which they came. Lenôtre then had to struggle to find a position in a kitchen in Normandy. Prior to the outbreak of World War II he sold his homemade chocolate creations in Paris from a bicycle.</p>

                <p>Following the war, Lenôtre opened a small bakery in Normandy. The venture was a success and in 1957 he came upon the opportunity to purchase a tiny bakery in the 16th Arrondissement of Paris. His new establishment did extremely well from the outset and is said to have presaged nouvelle cuisine. Lenôtre was renowned for concentrating on simple preparations and fresh ingredients, and for insisting on using the best butter in his pastries.</p>
                
                <p>The year 1964 saw Lenôtre enter the catering field. Due in large part to improvements in freezing food perishables, he was able to quickly expand the numbers of diners he was able to serve.</p>
                
                <p>The year 1971 saw Lenôtre open his first cooking school in Plaisir, Yvelines France. Among the chefs who studied under Lenôtre there was David Bouley and Jean-Paul Jeunet. The chef Pierre Hermé was an apprentice of his, as was the pastry chef Sébastien Canonne.[3] The chef Alain Ducasse also worked under him.</p>
                
                <p>In 1974 Lenôtre dispatched another then apprentice of his Michel Richard to open Chateau France a restaurant and patisserie on the East Side of Manhattan in New York City to spotlight the Lenôtre culinary style. It only stayed in business for a single year.</p>
                
                <p>Quickly bouncing back from this failed venture, in 1982 he opened les Chefs de France in the France Pavilion in Walt Disney World's Epcot Center together with Paul Bocuse and Roger Vergé.[4]</p>
                
                <p>In 1985 the businesses under the banner head Lenôtre were taken over by the French Hotel firm Accor.</p>

        <h6>Opera Cake</h6>

        <p>6–8 servings</p>
        <p>ACTIVE TIME: 2 hr</p>
        <p>TOTAL TIME: 3 1/2 hr (includes chilling buttercream and glaze)</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Almond Spounge Cake</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons cake flour (not self-rising), sifted after measuring, plus additional for dusting pan</li>
            <li>2 whole large eggs at room temperature for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>1 cup almond flour (3 1/2 oz) or 2/3 cup blanched whole almonds (see cooks' note, below)
            </li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar, sifted after measuring
            </li>
            <li>2 large egg whites at room temperature for 30 minutes
            </li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
            </li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, foam discarded, and butter cooled
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>Make sponge cake:
            Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Butter baking pan, then line bottom with a sheet of parchment or wax paper, leaving a 1-inch overhang on short sides, and generously butter paper. Dust pan with cake flour, knocking out excess.
            Beat whole eggs in a large bowl with a handheld electric mixer at high speed until eggs have tripled in volume and form a ribbon when beaters are lifted, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, then add almond flour and confectioners sugar and mix until just combined. Resift cake flour over batter and gently fold in.</p>

        <h3>Chefs Notes</h3>
        <p>If you can't find almond flour, you can pulse whole almonds with the confectioners sugar in a food processor until powdery (be careful not to grind to a paste). To take the temperature of a shallow amount of syrup, put bulb in saucepan and turn thermometer facedown, resting other end against rim of saucepan. Check temperature frequently. Opéra cake can be made 2 days ahead. Cover sides with strips of plastic wrap and top of cake loosely with plastic wrap (once glaze is set) and chill cake. Remove plastic wrap from top immediately after removing cake from refrigerator and bring cake to room temperature, 30 minutes to 1 hour</p>
